## Introduction
The Health Monitoring System is an innovative application designed to monitor and track health parameters in real-time. Using the MAX30100 sensor, the system collects vital health metrics such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Data is displayed and analyzed through ThingSpeak and Blynk databases, providing users with actionable health insights. This project was developed by a group of three students as part of our final year curriculum.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitors heart rate and blood oxygen levels using the MAX30100 sensor.
- **Data Storage:** Collects and displays health data in ThingSpeak and Blynk databases for remote access.
- **User Interface:** A landing page designed with HTML and CSS for easy user interaction.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Sends alerts when health parameters exceed normal ranges.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays health metrics graphically for easy analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Embedded C
- **Microcontroller:** Xiao ESP32
- **Sensor:** MAX30100
- **Frontend Technologies:** HTML, CSS
- **Data Visualization Platforms:** ThingSpeak, Blynk

## Usage
1. Upload the Embedded C code to the Xiao ESP32.
